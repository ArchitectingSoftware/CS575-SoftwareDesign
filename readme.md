# CS-575 Software Design

This repository contains resources for my CS575 Graduate Software Design
class that I teach at
[Drexel University's Computer Science Department](http://drexel.edu/cci/academics/departments/computer-science).

My goal of open sourcing this course is that it can help others learn about
modern software design principles, as well encouraging others to contribute
content and suggestions to improve the course.

Pull requests are welcome!
