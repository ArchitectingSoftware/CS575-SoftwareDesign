# Software Design Graduate Class (SE/CS 575)

This repository contains resources for my Graduate Software Design
class.

My goal of open sourcing this course is that it can help others learn about
modern software design principles, as well encouraging others to contribute
content and suggestions to improve the course.

Pull requests are welcome!
